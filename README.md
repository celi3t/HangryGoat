After 6 years, I am resurrecting this unfinished project like it's 2022 and my idea app for organizing recipes does not exist yet!

#### What is this project - current features

HangryGoat is a CLI tool to search for recipes only among my favorite foodblogs.
You can search by:
- title
- ingredients
- tags


#### How to run it
`python3 search/searcher_cli.py`


#### Future work

NLP fun: Improve the search by ingredients by creating n-grams

Webapp with GUI for search
